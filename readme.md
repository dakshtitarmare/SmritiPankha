# SmritiPankha: AI-Powered Intelligent Medication Guardian

> **A non-intrusive, static AI assistant designed to ensure medication adherence and provide proactive support for Alzheimer's patients.**

---

## 📖 Overview

**SmritiPankha** (meaning "Memory Fan" in Sanskrit) is an innovative, patent-pending healthcare solution that addresses one of the most critical challenges in Alzheimer's care: medication adherence. This repository documents our project's vision, technical approach, and impact, while protecting our proprietary technology and intellectual property.

**Note:** This repository contains project documentation only. The source code and implementation details are proprietary and not publicly available due to licensing restrictions.

## The Problem

For the 5.3 million+ families in India caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's and dementia, medication management is a daily source of anxiety. Cognitive decline leads to:

* **Missed Doses:** Accelerating health deterioration
* **Double Dosing:** Causing dangerous toxicity
* **Caregiver Burnout:** Constant uncertainty about medication compliance
* **Safety Risks:** Passive reminders (pillboxes, phone alerts) are easily ignored

Current solutions fail to provide definitive confirmation of medication intake without compromising patient dignity or requiring constant caregiver presence.

## 💡 Our Innovative Solution

We've developed a **static, intelligent guardian device** that operates on a closed-loop safety model:

1. **Intelligent Monitoring:** Device activates during scheduled medication times
2. **Precision Recognition:** Identifies specific pills and medications
3. **Action Verification:** Confirms actual intake via gesture analysis
4. **Proactive Assistance:** Provides gentle voice guidance during confusion
5. **Real-Time Updates:** Syncs logs to caregiver apps instantly

The system is designed to be **unobtrusive, privacy-focused, and dignity-preserving** — no wearables, no constant surveillance.
